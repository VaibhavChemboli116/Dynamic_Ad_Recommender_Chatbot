# Dynamic Ad-Recommender Chatbot

This project is a Python-based chatbot that dynamically injects relevant, sponsored product advertisements into a conversation. It uses **GPT-4o-mini** to maintain a natural dialogue and to periodically judge the topical coherence of the conversation. If the conversation remains on a consistent topic, the chatbot uses **SerpApi** to find a relevant product and seamlessly appends it to its response.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Conversational Tracking**: Maintains a history of the user and AI messages to provide context for responses.
- **Topical Coherence Analysis**: After every 4th user message, a GPT-4o-mini "judge" analyzes the last few exchanges to determine if they share a single, coherent topic.
- **Dynamic Ad Injection**: If the conversation is deemed coherent, the bot suggests a relevant product, searches for it using the SerpApi Google Shopping engine, and appends a sponsored link to its response.
- **Streaming Completions**: Utilizes streaming from the OpenAI API to ensure that answers are delivered smoothly and never cut off mid-sentence.
- **Thread-Safe Design**: Built to be thread-safe without requiring complex background threading.

## ðŸ§© How It Works

The chatbot's logic is orchestrated by the `AdRecommender` class:

1. **Conversation Buffering**:  
   The bot stores the conversation history (alternating user questions and AI answers) in a buffer. This buffer has a configurable maximum size to manage memory.

2. **Triggering the Ad Logic**:  
   A counter tracks the number of user questions. When this counter reaches 4, the ad-recommendation logic is triggered.

3. **Judging Topical Coherence**:  
   A "snapshot" of the last 7 lines of the conversation is sent to a GPT-4o-mini model acting as a judge. This judge is prompted to determine two things:  
   - Is the conversation on a single topic? (`RELATED: yes/no`)  
   - If yes, what is the topic and a suitable product/service? (`TOPIC: <topic>, P/S: <product>`)

4. **Searching for Products**:  
   If the judge confirms the conversation is related and suggests a product, the bot queries the SerpApi Google Shopping API for that product.

5. **Injecting the Ad**:  
   If a relevant product with a link is found, it is formatted into a markdown link and appended to the AI's primary response. The ad includes the product name, a direct link, and a short description.

6. **Resetting**:  
   The user message counter is reset to 0, and the cycle continues. An ad can potentially be shown every 4 user questions if the topic remains coherent.
